# Baby Names List Sorter (C#)

## Description

This C# console application checks whether lists of baby boy names from the United States are in alphabetical order. The names are provided in a text file (`TestInputs.txt`), with each line containing 100 names separated by commas. The program uses the `CompareTo` method to determine whether the names in each list are sorted. It writes "sorted" if the names are in alphabetical order, or "unsorted" if they are not.

## Features

- Reads lists of names from a text file (`TestInputs.txt`).
- Uses the `CompareTo` method to check if the names are in alphabetical order.
- Outputs "sorted" or "unsorted" for each list in the output file.
